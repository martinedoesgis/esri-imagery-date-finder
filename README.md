Map displaying the acquisition date and extent of Esri World Imagery. 

Esri provides this tool [here](https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=c1c2090ed8594e0193194b750d0d5f83) to know the aquisition date of its World Imagery but you can't display several metadata at the same (you need to click individually on each image and can then easily miss some small areas) so I recoded one that keeps all the extents loaded on the map.
